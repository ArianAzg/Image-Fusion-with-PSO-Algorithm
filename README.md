# Multispectral Image Fusion with PSO Algorithm

Description
----------
This code provides the fusion of PANchromatic (PAN) and MultiSpectral (MS) images using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The steps for fusion is as follows: 

    1) Loading the dataset from its path
    2) Pre-processing steps including downsampling and normalization.
    3) Initialization of PSO algorithm 
    4) Obtaining the primitive detail map for each spectral band 
    5) Extracting the edge detectors for PAN and MS images
    6) Fine-tuning the gains of edge detectors using PSO algorithm
